<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT --> 

## About The Project

In this project, I analyzed sales performance across supermarket store branches, evaluating how store size, inventory, and customer traffic impact sales. 
By exploring trends and relationships between variables, the project aims to derive actionable insights for optimizing store operations.

### Built With

This project was built with the following tools and libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org) for data manipulation and analysis
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and  [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for data handling
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for data visualization
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. If you're using Anaconda, it will come pre-installed with Python and several libraries. If not, you can install the following libraries:

- **numpy**
- **pandas**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Installation

1. **Using Anaconda Navigator**:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator and create a new environment or use an existing one.
   - Install the required libraries in that environment.

2. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KosyEzenwaji/Store-sales-analysis-with-python/.git
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries** (if not using Anaconda):

   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, install dependencies using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   If you're using Anaconda, you can launch Jupyter Notebook directly from Anaconda Navigator. Navigate to the project folder and launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stores.ipynb
   ```

 ## Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis is divided into three parts:

1. **Univariate Analysis**: Examining the distribution of individual variables such as `Items_Available`, `Daily_Customer_Count`, and `Store_Sales`.
   
2. **Bivariate Analysis**: Investigating relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., how `Store_Area` affects `Store_Sales`).
   
3. **Multivariate Analysis**: Exploring the relationships between multiple variables using correlation heatmaps and pair plots.
## Contributing
